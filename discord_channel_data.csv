frahlg%%<@865885852266004501> and <@988724186153361408> . Really good work with the presentations this weekend. I have now reported all grades in ladok. Essentially, those that missed PR have gotten an E even though they've made good reports.%%2023-08-28 17:24:30
nedamaleki%%No. They are more than 11. They are 21. One didnt show up. I have graded them on my paper and will enter them soon. ☺️%%2023-08-28 07:07:47
frahlg%%According to this doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eV5gFz-wuU0mT_nIzsGVwTwXCKKU0vuee1xeb96n2VY/edit#gid=0%%2023-08-28 06:46:48
frahlg%%11, is that right?%%2023-08-28 06:46:36
frahlg%%I've now gone through the grading document and checked Canvas, also graded them in Ladok.%%2023-08-28 06:46:30
arslanmusaddiq%%We re in the office.%%2023-08-26 07:54:22
frahlg%%Are you in the office or from home?%%2023-08-26 07:54:11
frahlg%%Great!%%2023-08-26 07:54:05

frahlg%%I'll join in just the first 10 minutes, I need to leave for a checking out a house%%2023-08-26 07:53:35
nedamaleki%%Yes it is on discord.%%2023-08-26 07:53:34
frahlg%%Ah see now. 🙂 Stages not started.%%2023-08-26 07:53:02
frahlg%%OK! Not on Discord??%%2023-08-26 07:51:35
nedamaleki%%We are ready and students are waiting in each rooms%%2023-08-26 07:50:03
arslanmusaddiq%%they are in presentation room 1 and 2.%%2023-08-26 07:50:00
arslanmusaddiq%%Yes👍 .%%2023-08-26 07:49:49
frahlg%%Are you ready? 🙂 Please make an announcement in the <#804009335721164822> channel (better if you do it as you're going to be there for all the presentations).%%2023-08-26 07:48:55
frahlg%%<@865885852266004501> <@988724186153361408> . I am online now.%%2023-08-26 07:48:13
frahlg%%Can you make a drive doc and share with students as before?%%2023-08-23 19:38:11
nedamaleki%%Sure☺️%%2023-08-22 19:36:38
frahlg%%OK, time to plan for the presentations! It seems that there might be about 24 reports to be done. I guess we will be able to plan for 10-14 and do two groups in parallell this Saturday?%%2023-08-22 11:34:19
arslanmusaddiq%%Also I found Jacob Törnvall was missing. I updated his grade also on Ladok.%%2023-07-13 15:21:47
arslanmusaddiq%%Hi <@367333391793782804> this student Love Suneson grade was missing. I updated her grade on Ladok. You can authorise it.%%2023-07-13 15:07:07
arslanmusaddiq%%Okay, I will also check to see if anyone who did not do it last time has completed it or not.%%2023-07-11 21:17:52
frahlg%%Yes I found it. Elias seems to have done the PR now, and I reported a grade.%%2023-07-11 21:15:37
arslanmusaddiq%%yes this is the document where we wrote grades and comments.%%2023-07-11 21:15:13
arslanmusaddiq%%https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eV5gFz-wuU0mT_nIzsGVwTwXCKKU0vuee1xeb96n2VY/edit#gid=0%%2023-07-11 21:14:58
frahlg%%You had a document for all presentations, right? Where you put some comments etc?%%2023-07-11 20:56:56
frahlg%%There's this guy Elias Soprani.%%2023-07-11 20:55:10
frahlg%%No I checked as well. He haven't done them,%%2023-07-11 20:54:50
arslanmusaddiq%%<@367333391793782804> I cannot find a peer review or a comment from student Teodor Widerberg on any report. The student said ha did a peer review. In Canvas, the student who did not write a comment on another student's report has an exclamation mark (!). I only see exclamation mark (!) where his name is appearing.%%2023-07-11 19:14:21
frahlg%%So I thought I did everyone, but quite many missing%%2023-07-11 15:35:58
frahlg%%I fixed it. It was my mistake, Ladok just defaults of showing 100 at a time%%2023-07-11 15:35:45
frahlg%%Also. We should have put C at more students I guess. When checking the study guide it’s more or less the standard if they’re just moderate active and have done everything https://lnu-ftk.instructure.com/courses/255/pages/study-guide%%2023-07-11 15:12:25
arslanmusaddiq%%Okay  👍%%2023-07-11 15:11:25
frahlg%%Just heading to the hotel in 20 min%%2023-07-11 15:11:03
arslanmusaddiq%%<@865885852266004501> can you check Ladok? the ones you graded are shown in "draft" in my Ladok.%%2023-07-11 15:10:57
frahlg%%Yes I’ll check%%2023-07-11 15:10:48
arslanmusaddiq%%<@367333391793782804> I checked Ladok, and saw we already graded those students that mentioned they did not receive a grade. Can you check if we missed something in Ladok?%%2023-07-11 14:51:14
quartie%%<@865885852266004501> <@988724186153361408> You rock!! 😍%%2023-07-11 11:43:04
arslanmusaddiq%%Yes, I will check tomorrow if any of those 13 have done quizzes or PR then will grade them in Ladok.%%2023-07-10 18:47:12
frahlg%%Oh that’s wonderful! This makes it much more streamlined.%%2023-07-10 18:46:52
nedamaleki%%Yes ☺️%%2023-07-10 18:46:23
frahlg%%So they are also in Ladok?%%2023-07-10 18:46:11
nedamaleki%%😞%%2023-07-10 18:45:29
frahlg%%I am melting away in the heat. Today has been really hot, and no AC in the conference%%2023-07-10 18:45:16
frahlg%%You’re already done? Great work!%%2023-07-10 18:44:44
nedamaleki%%Arslan and I did all grading both in the Excel file and Ladok.  Only 13 students (shown with the purple color) are not graded because they have not done either the Quizzes or Peer Review (everything is documented in the Excel file).%%2023-07-10 18:40:50
frahlg%%You could drop a message to the student and say that they need to finish this ASAP (today).%%2023-07-10 12:08:50
frahlg%%No grade at all. Quizzes and PR are mandatory.%%2023-07-10 12:08:25
arslanmusaddiq%%<@367333391793782804> If a student has not completed all the quizzes or has not done a peer review, how should we consider it when grading? For example, if a student receives a C on the project report but has not completed all the quizzes or a peer review, how will the grade be affected?%%2023-07-10 12:06:16
frahlg%%What matters is the comments on Canvas. My suggestion is to have a set of standard sentences which you can copy/paste, "Good project, nice to see" etc etc. "This could have been elaborated " ...%%2023-07-10 08:23:05
frahlg%%So no code reviewing etc. 🙂%%2023-07-10 08:21:46
frahlg%%And please don't be too detailed (I know both of you are 🙂 ). Put just a small amount of time, they are all very streamlined in format so it should be quick to check that all sections are there. And, better to let them pass than fail. It's "just" a summer course.%%2023-07-10 08:21:36
frahlg%%If there's any problems just let me know! I am available (listening on keynote at the same time ).%%2023-07-10 08:19:32
nedamaleki%%Hi. Sounds good 👍🏻%%2023-07-10 08:18:58
arslanmusaddiq%%Okay yes we will follow this way as you suggested. I am checking my ladok now. <@865885852266004501> we can divide them and grade those which we listened during presentation sessions.%%2023-07-10 08:14:41
frahlg%%Take help from <@257595609387761664> if needed.%%2023-07-10 08:12:21
frahlg%%all those that you are unsure about, flag them and I can have a look.%%2023-07-10 08:11:58
frahlg%%You decide on the best workflow. But optimally is if you also put the grade directly in Ladok as the last part. Then I can go in and authorise it (as an examiner).%%2023-07-10 08:11:36
frahlg%%Or . You could make a google drive doc with all information. Or use the same you've already have and just add new columns.%%2023-07-10 08:10:37
frahlg%%Or you can find your own workflow of course, if you divide the papers between you my guess is that you might be done in a couple of hours as you just need to check briefly all reports. Just skim it over.%%2023-07-10 08:09:52
frahlg%%So, my suggestion is that you log in to Ladok first and check how this is done. Maybe it could be a pretty streamlined process if you (1) check student on speedgrader (2) check if she/he has done peer review and quizzes (3) add the grade directly in Ladok.%%2023-07-10 08:09:00
frahlg%%<@865885852266004501> <@988724186153361408> you are added now in Ladok.%%2023-07-10 08:07:10
arslanmusaddiq%%Okay, yes 👍%%2023-07-10 07:40:37
frahlg%%We need to cross-check that they've done the peer review as well.%%2023-07-10 07:38:01
frahlg%%And when the Canvas is done we'll have to put this information in Ladok. Which is a manual process. So we will need to export the grading in .csv or equivalent.%%2023-07-10 07:33:54
frahlg%%Don't forget to follow the link and check.%%2023-07-10 07:32:48
arslanmusaddiq%%Yes, it wont be a problem.%%2023-07-10 07:32:40
frahlg%%In essence, the process will be like this.

1. Use the speedgrader in canvas. Put just a small comment "Great work" etc. on each and everyone.%%2023-07-10 07:32:36
frahlg%%As I've said, I think it will be quite a streamlined process as you've seen all presentations already. So in some way it's probably the most efficient way of doing it.%%2023-07-10 07:30:16
frahlg%%<@865885852266004501> <@988724186153361408> . I would ask of you to do the grading as well, it seems Mehdi hasn't responded.%%2023-07-10 07:29:39
frahlg%%We need to fix you a proper mic.%%2023-06-24 18:46:20
frahlg%%The sound was really low on your video <@988724186153361408> so I had to download it and run a normalize filter on the sound and re-upload it. Now it seems to be better. 🙂%%2023-06-24 18:46:11
frahlg%%The next weeks are more or less open. Tuesday 20th afternoon, or Thursday 22nd could be two dates. Or Wednesday-Friday the week after%%2023-06-12 17:00:04

I have created a Conference room on Canvas https://lnu-ftk.instructure.com/courses/233/conferences/129/join
Created slots on Calendar so that students can sign up for their slots. The slots are Mon to Wed 10-12, 14-16, 16-18 with a 20 minutes break in between hours (so 5 presentations in each session)
I also invited students so they book their slots.

frahlg%%Mid survey: "The idea to use Discord is one of the best decisions you have made. Even though this is a course on distance, it really feels like I'm part of a class, which have not been the feeling on other distance courses I've taken during the pandemic. The way people help each other, both other students and especially TA's is out of this world, I am really impressed with the cooperation. I don't think this level of cooperation would be possible if Discord wasn't used.

Probably the best course I've taken during several years of university studies, and it's not even over yet!

frahlg%%<@720956745194930197> . It's actually possible to use the Calendar in Canvas for all lectures. In this way the students (and we) subscribe to the calendar.%%2022-05-30 18:31:45
frahlg%%We need to just just start working on the planning document so it looks nice. But the information is there.%%2022-05-30 09:49:44
frahlg%%<@720956745194930197> . I have now switched to Canvas. The old links should still work but they all redirect to the Canvas site.%%2022-05-30 09:49:20

frahlg%%A question to you all. There is a possibility to use Canvas as a public homepage as well, and then we might actually use that instead of our https://coursepress.lnu.se/courses/applied-iot/ . That is this address instead  https://lnu-ftk.instructure.com/courses/233 . It will in that case be one less homepage for the students, and also easier for us to update information as we can do it directly in Canvas instead of pushing a '.md' file that is going to be built.%%2022-05-29 15:06:02

frahlg%%<@159652746222501897> you need access as well for the live stream. Are you using the dfm.coursepress@lnu.se login, or you need another?%%2022-05-27 09:33:50
frahlg%%The workflow is as following. Create a scheduled stream in Streamyard (with correct date and time). Then make sure you click Youtube as the endpoint. We will need to manually add the video to the playlist at youtube, but I can take care of that. Likewise we need some graphics for all videos (thumbnails). I think <@122739009611890688> might be the guy for this .... if you want?%%2022-05-27 09:32:36

frahlg%%``` Sign up for an assistant in the IoT summer course 2022
 
Hi,
 
You are getting this mail because you attended one of our previous summer courses in Applied IoT at Linnaeus University. I do hope that you thought it was worth your time and that you have been able to use what you learned. Anyway, this mail has a particular purpose – and that is that I am yet again searching for the best and most motivated IoT enthusiasts out there. 
 
Do you like to be a part of the team and lead workshops in the next summer course? 
 
You will get paid from Linnaeus University for your hours, and those can be flexible according to your own preference. Last year some assistants worked a bit more and some less. You will have an opportunity to get paid while doing what you love (if that’s IoT…). Most important, teaching experience from this course will for sure look good on your CV. And I will also, upon request from, personally write a recommendation letter on your behalf.
 
What I require:
-       You need to be an active and registered student at a European University.
-       You need to have passed the Applied IoT course, preferably A/B grade.
-       A keen interest in IoT.
 
Details:
The course starts at 6th of June and ends the 15th of July. Most workshops will take place during late afternoons and evenings, Tuesday – Thursday, the first four week of the course. 
 
How to apply:
Send me an email, no later than 22nd April with:
-       a short description of why you want to join.
-       Your CV (this is required of the University)
-       A link to your previous project
 
By the way, we are planning yet another 24h livestream this summer as well – save the date for 21st of June.

What I would like to ask from <@!552999170005401600> or any other TA is if you want to prepare some learnings from the workshop. And maybe some fun facts or stuff that happened during the course? <@784419624744910919> <@839156703470944297> <@811358371004940289> , if you want to join in and just say hi or just join in and share your voice and contribution that would be great.%%2021-08-11 14:09:03

frahlg%%So my workflow was that I had all the pre-recorded presentations lined up in a separate chome browser, with all presentations in their own tab. You will perhaps need an external monitor as it might be good to not have your screen filled%%2021-08-09 16:34:05
francispalma%%Good to know!%%2021-08-09 16:34:04
frahlg%%<@!720956745194930197> . I have now done a full day of presentations... When you are showing recorded videos, use the "Share Tab" and don't forget the "Share audio" button. I think it's best if you try this in beforehand with streamyard only recording (not streaming).%%2021-08-09 16:32:48

francispalma%%I will look into this.%%2021-07-05 14:54:01
frahlg%%For me it's fine if you want to check yourself. I guess it is certainly possible. Francis - maybe you can initiate this.%%2021-07-05 14:33:07
francispalma%%since it also depends on the availability of the speaker, could be possible, but unsure%%2021-07-05 13:52:20
marcozennaro%%I would love to, but Thursday is crazy busy for me. Looks like a perfect storm of meetings, all on Thursday. Any chance of moving it to some other day?%%2021-07-05 13:50:39
frahlg%%That is if <@!784419624744910919> is up for hosting a guest presentation with Jamie Trinidad from The Things Industries.%%2021-07-05 13:35:05

frahlg%%<@!720956745194930197> . You should now have all information of the guest presentations next week. If there's a presentation I would think <@!784419624744910919> would be perfect for it's the one with TTI.%%2021-07-05 13:34:12
frahlg%%I'll send you emails.%%2021-07-05 12:45:59
francispalma%%Can you share the email ids of the respective speakers?%%2021-07-05 11:34:57
francispalma%%Or I can ask also Marco if he wants to host one of the sessions on Monday or Tuesday (so that students do not get bored seeing the same face again and again 😉  )%%2021-07-05 11:05:25
frahlg%%Monday, Sensative. Tuesday Tele2. Thursday TTI.%%2021-07-05 11:00:52
frahlg%%I know. But it just feels a bit strange that I am handing over this. If you can take next week that would be golden.%%2021-07-05 11:00:10
francispalma%%I could take it also if you have other engagements.%%2021-07-05 10:22:20
frahlg%%<@!720956745194930197> . I just talked to Johan at iot-ab.se, and I think I'll have to take the session this evening. Seems very odd to me to hand it over in the last minute when I have had all contacts so far. So this week I will handle both Monday and Wednesday guest lecture sessions.%%2021-07-05 08:14:51

I have talked with Wienke and it was fine for us to use that video in the course. <@!784419624744910919> I guess this will be a really good introduction to LoRa that complements your material <@!784419624744910919> ?%%2021-06-18 09:14:25

frahlg%%See it as a Q&A.%%2021-06-18 09:10:20

Anna Förster%%<@!367333391793782804> sorry, it seems like my exercises and quizzes are not really good for this course. they are very much computtaion-intensive and all based on old sensor nodes (Z1).

Anna Förster%%the schedule says Wed, 17th. But 17th is Thursday ... Honestly, I would prefer Wed, 16th - is that possible?%%2021-06-08 15:37:01
francispalma%%<@!839156703470944297> Your session was initially planned on June 17th at 18:00 if you check here https://coursepress.lnu.se/courses/applied-iot/03-planning

Anna Förster%%sounds good to me.%%2021-06-08 08:20:12
frahlg%%Then we'll put up a quiz on Canvas that is linked to your videos. And on top of this we'll plan a Q&A.

frahlg%%I will handle all the quizmaking%%2021-06-08 07:54:29

Anna Förster%%ok, so how should we go ahead here? offer the online videos and myself in a slot for questions? when exactly?%%2021-06-08 07:52:44
frahlg%%My first idea was to have introduction videos recorded by each of us. But we are so many ...%%2021-06-08 07:52:32
frahlg%%Yes, I checked it. It's really good. 🙂 Some parts might even be a little too advanced for the syllabus, but as the students seem to be very strong it should not matter.%%2021-06-08 07:51:58
Anna Förster%%also, do we need still the intro videos of ourselves?%%2021-06-08 07:50:36
Anna Förster%%have you checked the online material? I am happy to prepare also something else or a mish-mash of the existing stuff ..%%2021-06-08 07:50:19
marcozennaro%%Perfect! Thanks <@!720956745194930197>%%2021-06-07 13:55:25
francispalma%%<@!784419624744910919> what about June 23rd?%%2021-06-07 13:51:23
francispalma%%Done, so confirmed for 14th Jul%%2021-06-07 13:22:43
Pietro Manzoni%%July 14th is ok👍🏻. Thanks%%2021-06-07 13:08:27
marcozennaro%%Like 21 or 22 June? That would be perfect.%%2021-06-07 12:50:58
marcozennaro%%Last time I have been sick for two days after the vaccination. A later date?%%2021-06-07 12:48:43
francispalma%%July 8th is Thursday (not Wednesday, as written on the plan)%%2021-06-07 10:38:09
francispalma%%<@!811358371004940289> Tuesday and Thursdays are preferably set for Workshops. What about July 14th?%%2021-06-07 10:33:27
frahlg%%I updated the schedule%%2021-06-06 16:57:05
frahlg%%I guess Anna is fine with that, in my understanding she is going to mainly propose her pre-recorded material.%%2021-06-06 16:54:30
frahlg%%Maybe we can just take it on the 17th?%%2021-06-06 16:53:53
marcozennaro%%Hi Fredrik, I will be getting my second shot on the 16th (and will have to travel on the 15th). When can we re-schedule my talk on wireless options for IoT?%%2021-06-06 13:22:14
frahlg%%Absolutely, <@!720956745194930197> is in charge of the schedule - can you change this?%%2021-06-06 12:14:23
Pietro Manzoni%%OK, thanks! So I see week 27 has empty spots, how about July 8th?%%2021-06-06 07:58:08
frahlg%%Sure! We can move around without limits. 🙂%%2021-06-05 06:59:05
Pietro Manzoni%%hi, last week of june is complicated to me because I'll be going back to Spain from my "internship" in Italy that I'm currently doing. Is there any way to move my lecture to July? tanks! Ciao%%2021-06-04 10:40:55
frahlg%%I had a chat with two students during my morning walk. Really nice. I must say that I am truly impressed by the backgrounds they have. One of them I talked to had 30+ experience from planning cellular radio planning, and also developed optimisation routines for backend.%%2021-06-03 19:42:36
frahlg%%The 22nd July many will have come a far way with their projects. Some might even be done.%%2021-06-03 09:28:34
frahlg%%I just thought of an idea. Of course we are going to include our student projects in the live stream 22/7. That is, let's include the best and most interesting projects during the live stream.%%2021-06-03 09:28:10
frahlg%%I have updated the planning with a guest lecture from Tele2 the 13th of July.%%2021-06-01 12:12:12

frahlg%%I am also new to this, and relying much on my TA:s. 🙂%%2021-05-05 06:42:35

marcozennaro%%Thanks Fredrik. I really like Discord and I think I will be using it for some of my activities. I will ask you many questions in the next weeks!%%2021-05-04 19:29:04
