Some other recordings have debatable quality. Basically too much space on screen is used for less valuable content. \nProposal, look on Stockholm University, applied project management at DSV. I am impressed by their recordings.\n- As said before and partially implemented in this course:\n      Collect all shared links in a library and share it.\n\nWell done in this course to have a set of key links.!!!\nLike the one for canvas access.  More than one university in Sweden have homepages making the hunt for the canvas starting point kind of a course exam criteria. 😳\n\nThe TA team, engaged students do change the world and kept me sane when finding that the Micro Python implementation was buggy. What a patience! What an attitude!\n\nI think micro python compared with C is a good way to go as being done in the course. \n\nFinally, and maybe to be discussed later on, the selection of seminars. Some was for awareness which is good, some was for teaching things.

I would have loved an intro on LTE aswell in tutorial fashion, but i understand why it was not included.\n\nThe lectures: 3\nAs an introductory course i loved the general lectures, it was fun to see just what you could do with these devices. However, i personally would have really liked more on point lectures where you actually learn the programming and basics of the subject rather than an overview on projects done by others. I am not totally new to programming, but VERY new to electronics, currents, soldering, connections, measurements and such, as well as the interaction between code and devices.\n\nProject: 4\nYou weren´t joking when you said that the problems would start to arise when you disconnected the device from USB or tried to connect it to various networks. But other than that headache, it was really fun to think of a project, and then try to realise it... and then stumbling and falling along the way due to... well... issues 😛\n\nIoT in general:\nWell, my teeth have been bloodied, and i am hungry for more... now i just have to find the time in my very busy schedule to actually dwell deeper into this project.\n\nThanks for an awesome course, was among the best courses i´ve had!","re":[{"c":6,"n":"👍"}]},"875731831247491082":{"u":12,"t":1628861138880,"m":"I really enjoyed this course, this pushed me to work and adapt a planned project and extend it. \n\nI hope that a similar but more advanced course is planned (applied not II? Maybe something with advanced sensors and machine learning on the device / using ). \n\nDiscord worked well for this maybe have some more data on how the bots are used earlier in the course. Canvas worked well for the quizzes but it would be nice to have the option to change the peer review without contacting a teacher but I guess that is a canvas limitation. The course was nicely paced and well scheduled (I guess thats why workflow such as git was not included). \n\nThe use of YouTube and streamyards/streamlabs(?) worked well both for personal presentation and for lectures and vlogs. \n\nThe recommended hardware with python seems as a good tool to get started (and to get something working with less hassle).\n\nThe workshops was a great way to get help and thoughts from teacher assistants.\n\nThe presentations was nice to be in and to listen to. Some of them inspire me to start some future projects.\n\nThank you all teacher and teaching-assistants for running this course.","re":[{"c":2,"n":"👍"}]},"875733506406367252":{"u":12,"t":1628861538269,"m":"I also want to ad that I enjoy the W32 vlog that showcase the statistics.\nWhen I sat in the silent work it felt a little quick untill I was moved to AFK, I later did not use it when I worked.","r":"875731831247491082","re":[{"c":1,"n":"👍"}]},"876162253701914665":{"u":13,"t":1628963759590,"m":"I've already gave my feedback about the course in \"🎥live-stream\" on July 30th. \nI just want to thank again at the end of the course.

Even including my mandatory classes at uni. \nThe thing that you have nailed the most is: The way the lectures are made (really nice to learn by listening to a live talk show about a certain subject)\nDiscord and the different channels are also very instructive and helpful. The TA's were spectacular at doing their job. \nThe idea of doing a tutorial instead of project report is also very cool! Very passionate guest lectures and very nice and easy way to communicate with everyone including the distributors. The quizzes were also helpful and were well balanced regarding the complexity considering it is an introduction course ✅ \n\nThe thing that I had higher expectations for are the workshops. I thought that I would interact with all the different people and work together on solving the tutorials, and really become closer together during the course. I was expecting a workshop to be something like sitting in small voice channels 3-5 people each time and trying to help each other and if there is anything unclear then a TA would join and help us. In that way we interact much more with each other. It becomes really interesting when reading the tutorials at the end of the course and then recognising the person that worked on the project. But instead we sat all together in one voice channel and worked individually while only one shared a screen and got help. That is why the silent work channel got so popular in the end in my opinion. Improvements were made every workshop and more specific voice channels were added even the \"work together\" voice channels which is so nice to see! But it was maybe too little too late. So for me personally I didn't feel that the workshops stood up for their names as any difference from the normal academic assignments system.","re":[{"c":5,"n":"👍"}]},"878964417763614721":{"u":15,"t":1629631847564,"m":"Hej, thank you for this class.

So, any feedback if/how I could work on this idea or look into something else, would be much appreciated. thank you 🙂"},"1118857419469094923":{"u":98,"t":1686826796167,"m":"Hi, Would a project involving reading temperature/humidity through the humidity  sensor and sending the values to adafruit and then depending on certain threshold values also send an alert through a webhook to discord be okay?"},"1118860033602617467":{"u":2,"t":1686827419425,"m":"interesting, where do you visualize it? is it an app on your mobile or a webpage...","r":"1118845000151748608"},"1118860483609493544":{"u":2,"t":1686827526715,"m":"It fulfil the practical part of the project and you need to make a tutorial on the steps to make similar system 🙂","r":"1118857419469094923"},"1118860706410938481":{"u":98,"t":1686827579835,"m":"okay thank you! 🙏"},"1118862352427786321":{"u":93,"t":1686827972276,"m":"My project idea is to measure/ monitor the humidity and temperature in my apartment.

This would be achieved with a distance sensor so it can measure the amount the chairs piston has decompressed, and a gyro in case the person leans back and that leads the distance sensor to not measure the distance correctly.\n\n2: I have a cat with a water fountain at home, and if the fountain runs with a low water level it makes a horrible noise because the pump is running semi dry. I would like to have a water level sensor or something of that nature that warns the user when the water level is running low, and shuts the water fountain off if it gets too low so the pump doesn’t get any unnecessary wear and so it doesn’t scare/annoy the cat. I don’t really know how to shut the fountain off for now, I have two ideas. Either trying to integrate a smart plug or a relay.

You can replace AI with some good old fashioned mathematics. If you have a sampled sound file you can use one of many methods (Periodogram, Fast Fourier Transfer,  Welch's method, etc.) to estimate the signal's so called 'spectral density' which will show the magnitude of each frequency in the signal. Each method has its own pros and cons with tradeoffs in accuracy, bias, resolution and variance. From this you can identify isolated peaks which would correspond to each note which then only has to be translated into the corresponding note. Since the overtones of each instrument are usually much smaller in magnitude than the fundamental note, this should (in theory) give the same result regardless of instrument, but I might be mistaken. I have never worked with micropython personally but if it is anything like regular python the methods mentioned above should be available in libraries for easier use.\n\nThe picture shows middle C being played on a trombone processed with the fast fourier transfer as an example of how the spectral density could look (the fundamental peak is around 267 Hz). I hope this helps and is not too daunting. Hopefully built-in libraries can do most of the heavy lifting for you.

It really embodies the idea of communication in this course.\nOn thing to look out for when working with micropython is that you have a size limitation since your code and libraries need to fit into the relatively small memory of the device. So big math libraries like numpy might not fit. \nHowever, There are many micropython implementation of these libraries that reduce the size so you might be able to use one of them if you decide to go that path.

Självklart är det bra om du antecknar så mycket och tydligt som möjligt, men du behöver inte lägga någon extra tid på layout eller renskrivning. När föreläsningen är slut skickar du anteckningarna via mail till studenten. Lönen för jobbet som anteckningshjälp är 65 kronor i timmen + 12% semesterersättning och betalas ut av Linnéuniversitetet.

It's mainly the size and how strong they are. (There is also some forward-voltage drop differences..., but you won't need to think about that).\nFor the resistors, you are probably OK with anything between 330 Ohm and 10K Ohm. If you have a few of them you can also combine them (in series they add up, and in parallel they \"divide\".)\nI haven't seen your course, but the photoresistor is probably going to be attached to an ADC (analog-to-digital converter) port, and a different resistance probably just means that you see different values.

This is not a complain, this is a real feedback and a different perspective that I’m showing"},"990917578534846464":{"u":21,"t":1656323561081,"m":"i mean my parts are still not working yet"},"990917598550036530":{"u":21,"t":1656323565853,"m":"got them yesterday"},"990617489148878900":{"u":310,"t":1656252014196,"m":"is there anyone that has managed to make their Heltec screen work? i have tried all possible tutorials from this discord and from the internet and nothing seems to work"},"990621115019829261":{"u":129,"t":1656252878671,"m":"Draw.io","r":"990599540447010846"},"990623637029650553":{"u":31,"t":1656253479965,"m":"Would you like me to send the library I used and a code snippet?","r":"990617489148878900"},"990623838297546762":{"u":21,"t":1656253527951,"m":"looks like a discrete standard deviation function but I might be wrong, not my area of expertise :))","r":"990599540447010846"},"990624145467379742":{"u":24,"t":1656253601186,"m":"I assume you mean the built-in sensors on the Pysense expansion board?

Not easy anyway, cause FM is a modulated signal-technology. This goes deeper into Electronic Enginering, and one need to measure the signal to reverse Engineers it. But if you are lucky, maybe someone has done this for your air conditioner. Easiest is if the air conditioner is  of a simple nature, just off/on if you pull out/Put back in the plug.

Someone mentioned that some sensors will not be compatible to some devices, so will these work for the Arduino?\n4. Another discussion related to sensors was which ones to use and apparently not all of them will be compatible with all libraries (whatever that means).

When the device has power it will run the files boot and then main, since you're using pybytes it will connect to wifi too.\n\nQ2: Yes the wifi antenna gives a little better range, but remember that the LoRa/Sigfox antenna is not the same as the wifi antenna and is placed differently on the Lopy.

Min PIR, enligt databladet och erfarenhet, ger falska positiva första minuten, under \"initieringen\" som det beskrivs.\n\nSen är det ju märkligt att din pin mäter high även fast det inte är ngn spänning. Det låter då som att det ngt krångel med det pin:et. Testa gärna en annan och se om du upplever problem igen. \n\nSen är det en rekommendation, om du inte redan gör det, att alltid köra PULL_DOWN (när du vill ha 0a i normalfallet) för att undvika spänningsvandring som annars uppstår.","te":1593253190509,"re":[{"c":1,"n":"👍"}]},"726460089237635154":{"u":42,"t":1593271982250,"m":"<@!721112699341111437> Ja, dom har jag ställt in som jag vill ha dom. :/ \n\n<@!552999170005401600> HC-SR501 har jag.

Using an input voltage that isn't just standard USB (5V) could thus fry the USB->Serial chip.\nAt that point you might still be able to program it by using another board and using that one's converter.\n\nAlso note: the AMS1117 and LD1117 regulators are extremely forgiving. From what I remember they have thermal protections, ... to avoid getting damaged. Even if you connect 3V3 to GND you will most likely not damage your board as the regulator will just shut down. (Don't try it, though).\n\nShortening, on the other hand, is significantly easier to do by accident. Just plugging an LED directly from VCC/GND to a pin will exceed the current a pin can sink/source.\n\nA different, slower damage, can happen when you handle boards without being grounded. Static electricity (sparks) will most likely not outright destroy your device, but will slowly damage the device and make it less reliable. (That said: I generally don't do anything special. Just stay away from carpets...)\n\nFinally: All ESP32s are rated for 5V *logic* levels. That is, you are allowed to connect 5V directly to the pins (*not* the VCC input).

Also if anyone wants to buy a powerbank consider getting one that does not have leds or at least be able to disable them because they are a concern when trying to minimize power draw. Lastly, a powerbank is my usually go to method to power my remote projects but it suffers from the fact that the output voltage is boosted from whatever the battery inside is running at so a good amount of power is wasted that way compared to hooking up the battery directly.","r":"984211457170354296","re":[{"c":2,"n":"❤️"}]},"984221198546272276":{"u":129,"t":1654727019679,"m":"That’s good information about the power bank, thankful 🙏🏻 been looking at a lot of rover projects and alot of them are powered by power banks.

Water the plants automatically.\n4. Show values on a screen (i have some options home for that from a rasperry pi kit)\n\nMy main problem right now concerns number 3 on my wishing list. I want to use a simple, gravity based system, so to say. So I want to screw on a waterbottle with a cap that has a hole and a pipe in it, turn it upside down and have it higher than my plants. Then I need a valve that can be opened automatically, based on the measurement of the moisture in the pot.\nMy question is: Which valve can I use for such a system? I couldn't really find something on electrokit, it seemed to me that the valves there needed certain pressure to work. \n\nI am also unsure which batterykit i should buy, if i want to plug it into the board directely.

LoS is blocked by various boulders and cliffs so we do not actually see the tub from the house.\n\nProject Idea: I want a thermometer which measures and statistically store data for water temperature from the hot tub, and by some means this data, both statistical and current temperature should be able to be accessed in some way.\n\nNow, i bought the complete set from Electrokit, and i also bought a FiPy.\nThis because i guessed that the LoPy wouldn´t cut it rangewise to the house.\n\nFor this i am aware that i need to also purchase an antenna(i was thinking an antenna kit directly from Pycom that was linked in another channel along with a batterypack to run the device(Was thinking of the AAA kind).\n\nAlong with this i am guessing this is the type of sensor i need:\nhttps://www.electrokit.com/produkt/temperatursensor-vattentat-metallholje-ds18b20/\n\nNow, my question here is, am i completely out cycling in the sea in regards to this project or am i on the right track? 😛","e":[{"url":"https://www.electrokit.com/produkt/temperatursensor-vattentat-metallholje-ds18b20/","type":"link"}]},"852540607405883422":{"u":391,"t":1623331920244,"m":"Ålright, so according to the image you provided I want the V version as I can use separate voltages for power and signal?

And then I can set the \"normal\" for each type of plant, all from one app. Some plants need more water than others.

But I don't know enough about gardening to know what to measure. So maybe that's just a dream.\n\nBut I want it to be set up so that when the water tank level needs refilling it sends me an alert on the phone app. I am really guilty of forgetting to water my plants, so if I have a self watering system that helps, but not if I forget to fill the tank with water. \n\nI imagine I need some kind of water tank/housing system and valve, but I haven't the foggiest idea where to start.

I thought that could be cool to try out 🤷‍♂️ I ordered an RTC bc I want to collect date and time together with humidity and temperature. It had very little documentation and I almost got it to work, but it was either conflicting I2C or UART errors. When I vacuumed the Internet I stumbled upon a guy on YouTube who synced RTC with NTP-source over WiFi, with his Pico W and with micropython too. All boxes checked! So of course I HAD TO try that out instead 😅 and the amazing thing is: it also worked! So my DS3231 is on pause for now and I’m syncing time from internet instead, to me it is really cool!

The phone was completely broken and could no longer be used. \nIt was this collaborative effort that led to our first handmade frame, which we called an iPhone 6 deconstruction frame. Although this frame wasn’t very exquisite, we received unexpected compliments when we shared it with friends. Some friends even wanted to purchase it, which greatly encouraged us. So, we made it our mission to bring beautiful deconstruction art to more people.\n\nNot only it looks eye catching with the artwork in the frame created by “XREART” but it’s also environmental friendly. \n\n“E-waste disposal contributes to climate change due to the chemicals released when it is burned. Electronics contain materials like copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), and iron (Fe), and when burned these metals accumulate in the air.” Electronic waste has gone up 21% in the past 5 years. Not only you are forced to make a purchase at a high price. But you’re able to download the DIY and follow the instructions on creating your own frame. \n\nIf interested you may use my referral JOHNNYDEV to gain 10 percent discount. // Free Templates do exist.

To get wine you have to beg, and show that you are submissive and beneath the Beg-In-Box. It does this with pose classification, and you have to place your head beneath the box looking down, or look REALLY sad to classify as begging. Then you have say the swedish word ”Snälla!”, and then you get a teeny-tiny bit of wine through a solenoid valve connecte to the box. As I am a total beginner and cant code well, I used a raspberry pi to run mediapipe and control a relay that provides the solenoid valve with power, and then a microbit with an edge impulse voice recognition model to control the actual valve opening. So first you have to pose, then say the word during the posing. Like explained this works most of the time, as the two conditions have to be filled to make the wine flow….however, like mentioned above, ”misbehaviour” from the user can cause issues that I want to fix.

The GPIO in above code is providing 12v power to a solenoid valve, and then the microbit opens the valve when you both BEG over 0.76 and say the word. As long as a person is in the image, everything works fine. Its only if some gets out of image too fast and the GPIO gets stuck on high that there is a problem.

I saw that you do ship to Spain but I'm a bit wary about buying the starter kit since it says it isn't in stock. I wouldn't want to miss the first ten days of the course, but even more so I wouldn't want to risk paying for a kit only for it to arrive to Spain when I'm already back in Sweden and won't be going back. Do you have any ETA on the starter kit, and any (more or less) guaranteed shipping time?

Early orders also help us, as some components have long lead times even at the best of times.\n\nIf you have technical questions, I recommend putting these in the appropriate Discord channel here. Me and my colleagues are smart and quick but we are nowhere near as smart and quick as 200-something students and TAs.\n\n***Test your board as soon as possible.*** Raspberry Pi Picos are tested at the factory ans there are close to zero problems at delivery but if there is, it's better to know sooner rather than later. It's good to check the sensors too, but they are generally easier to replace.\n\nIf you have any issues with you order (payment, delivery etc.) I recommend support@electrokit.se as we are more people checking that one than this channel. You can ask here or in DM, of course, but response time is probably a bit slower.\n\nIf you have a question that you feel more people can benefit from, write here so that we can share the knowledge.\n\nFollowing your work in this course is incredibly exciting.\n\nI wish you a great course and summer!","re":[{"c":3,"n":"👍🏻"}]},"1103201942085312522":{"u":553,"t":1683094239494,"m":"Hey everyone!

I'm disappointed with the handling of my order and the delayed cancellation announcement, even though you ensured Electrokit shipped it a week ago and confirmed everything's well. Additionally, you predicted a delivery for the week commencing. Still, it has been four weeks since I completed the order losing valuable time pending for it, whilst I could have ordered elsewhere. It will be arduous to find providers for the hardware, considering I'm in Greece. Therefore, I am stranded with two options; either the order won't be delivered in time, or I will pay for overpriced equipment. Hence my participation in the course won't produce any beneficial results, and I am not keen on making futile efforts. I will forgive the tardiness, but I find it unprofessional that Electrokit promised a delivery in Greece as an exception to the listed shipping countries and reneged it.

I am completely new to the world of IoT and am probably going to go for the FiPy and sensors bundle as a starting point and was thinking about adding on EEG/EKG/EMG sensors to explore controlling my IoT device that way.  The two major biometric options I have looked at are either the 'Cable for three electrodes 4mm/3.5mm' (41013082) +' Biometric electrodes 10-pack' (41013083) or sacrificing EEG capabilities for the more long term usable option 'Passive electrodes for EKG/EMG Shield' (41011218). \n\nThe questions I have are several. Firstly, I see that the electrodes are currently out of stock and was wondering if that is long term enough to affect availabilty to the start of the course. Secondly, regarding the electrodes I was wondering how much of a single use they are. Will I need to constantly buy new electrodes each time I want to use my device or will one electrode be able to be used for a longer time? Thirdly, I see that the second option requires I also buy the EKG/EMG Shield (41010261) and was wondering if that would also be the case for the first option and if I need additional components to make that work with my FiPy microcontroller. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, will these sensors and eventual extra components be compatible with the FiPy bundle I intend to use as a base? \n\nAs I am still quite lost in this area please feel free to raise relevant concerns connected to this idea that I might not be aware of yet.

I have a couple questions \n\n1. I've decided do a possibly basic Ring doorbell knock off type of project. I've ordered and received the pycom board with sensor bundle. But I'm wondering what else I need to get. The first step of the project is to have a camera that is activated when the doorbell is pressed and we receive notifications on our phones via an app. So I need to order a doorbell button (as we have none), and I know I need a camera. I saw you only had one on your website, and I wasn't sure if it was suitable or not. Plus, if memory serves, it was out of stock. But if I'm planning to have the camera be activated by pressing of the button, is there some kind of sensor or switch or something I need to get that is not already in the bundle? \n\n2. V. 28 and 29 I am out of town, up to the high coast for my mother in law's memorial. So if I need something, that is out of stock (and back in stock while I'm away), or whatever, is it possible to have it sent to a temp address?"},"859833664295534602":{"u":385,"t":1625070720505,"m":"3.

When temperature exceeds like 24 degrees or something It will open the window with a 12V DC-motor and a gear strip + a gear wheel for about 25cm. Outside I have planned to plant a rain sensor so that the window closes if it starts to rain heavy. Bucket of water on the floor, water pump at the bottom and tubes to the plants so they can water them self ;) also a camera ofc, I will try to present as much data as possible and have some buttons in an Android app so that I can monitor and control the balcony from anywhere! My soon to be wife have a Bachelor in biology/gardening so I hope to get some help with what's needed/important for the plats. Maybe some small fans as well to get some movement on the leaves :)","re":[{"c":3,"n":"👌"},{"c":2,"n":"👍"}]},"854613852809199626":{"u":543,"t":1623826220467,"m":"<@231509356510838784> 👍"},"854682592661995520":{"u":199,"t":1623842609325,"m":"Nice project, Iam thinking about a similar project since I have a ton of tomato plants on my balcony that I want to automate.

The way it works is that you put sugar some liquid and some kind of yeast in a bottle and then when the pressure inside gets high enough it gets carbonated and is ready to drink. One fun thing would be to have a sensor that in some way can detect when it is sufficiently pressurised. Normally I make a dimple in the bottle when sealing it, then when the pressure gets high enough it will \"pop\" the dimple indicating that there is pressure in the bottle. So one way to do this I guess would be to either have a motion sensor or a noise sensor that detects the pop and then signals it some way wirelessly. However the pop only indicates that it is on the right track, its not an indicator that its ready to drink yet. So another more sophisticated way would be to somehow measure the pressure inside the bottle directly, this way it would also be possible to find the ideal pressure for perfect carbonised soda but I'm not sure if that kind of pressure sensor is available and how to actually implement it 🙂\nIt's one idea at least that I think would be feasible to implement without that much difficulty, atleast the easier variants.","te":1623921015760,"re":[{"c":1,"n":"😍"},{"c":3,"n":"👍"}]},"855014992712564746":{"u":16,"t":1623921859673,"m":"Something like this could maybe be placed inside the bottle https://www.electrokit.com/produkt/bmp180-lufttryckssensor-monterad-pa-kort/ (width is 10mm on the short side)\n\nIt requires soldering though, but there are good guides out there how to do it.
