I do hope that you thought it was worth your time and that you have been able to use what you learned. Anyway, this mail has a particular purpose – and that is that I am yet again searching for the best and most motivated IoT enthusiasts out there. \n \nDo you like to be a part of the team and lead workshops in the next summer course? \n \nYou will get paid from Linnaeus University for your hours, and those can be flexible according to your own preference. Last year some assistants worked a bit more and some less. You will have an opportunity to get paid while doing what you love (if that’s IoT…). Most important, teaching experience from this course will for sure look good on your CV. And I will also, upon request from, personally write a recommendation letter on your behalf.\n \nWhat I require:\n-       You need to be an active and registered student at a European University.\n-       You need to have passed the Applied IoT course, preferably A/B grade.\n-       A keen interest in IoT.\n \nDetails:\nThe course starts at 6th of June and ends the 15th of July. Most workshops will take place during late afternoons and evenings, Tuesday – Thursday, the first four week of the course. \n \nHow to apply:\nSend me an email, no later than 22nd April with:\n-       a short description of why you want to join.\n-       Your CV (this is required of the University)\n-       A link to your previous project\n \nBy the way, we are planning yet another 24h livestream this summer as well – save the date for 21st of June. \n```"},"956989343514378310":{"u":0,"t":1648234439496,"m":"First application for TA in.
